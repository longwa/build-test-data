== Upgrading
When upgrading from older versions of Grails, first follow the standard Grails upgrade process.

=== Performance Improvements
The core plugin has been refactored to reduce metaClass dependency and remove a few poor performing contructs (I'm looking at you ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider).

Most of the plugin classes have also been converted to `@CompileStatic`. In addition, the DomainInstanceBuilder can be cached and re-used to prevent additional overhead.

=== Abstract Classes
Concrete subclasses are no longer discovered automatically. If you graph needs to build an abstract class, use the `abstractDefaults` parameter in `TestDataConfig` to specify a concrete subclass.

```groovy
abstractDefault = [
    'test.AbstractBook'   : MyBook,
    'test.AbstractAuthor' : Tolkien
]
```

=== Config Parameters
Some test data config parameters such as `abstractDefault` and `sampleData` used to allow either a Class or String as the map key.

In 3.3 and later, only a full package name String is allowed.

=== Disabling Via TestDataConfig
You can no longer disable via the `testDataConfig.enabled = false` option.

=== Unit Tests
Most of the work when upgrading to Grails 3.3.x will involve refactoring related to the framework itself with only minor changes for build-test-data.

---
```groovy
@Build([Author])
class AuthorSpec extends Specification {
    ...
}
```

Just add the trait:
```groovy
@Build([Author])
class AuthorSpec extends Specification implements BuildDataTest {
    ...
}
```

Optionally, use the standard Grails mock method:

```groovy
class AuthorSpec extends Specification implements BuildDataTest {
    void setupSpec() {
        mockDomains(Author)
    }
    ...
}
```

or by overriding the *getDomainClassesToMock* method:

```groovy
class AuthorSpec extends Specification implements BuildDataTest {
    Class[] getDomainClassesToMock() {
        [Author]
    }
    ...
}
```

or use with the BuildDomainTest and generics
```groovy
class AuthorSpec extends Specification implements BuildDomainTest<Author>{
    ...
}
```

WARNING: Make sure you use *DomainUnitTest* for unit tests and *TestDataBuilder* for integration tests.

=== Integration Tests
For integration tests, follow the standard Grails upgrade instructions and then add the `TestDataBuilder` trait:

```groovy
@Integration
@Rollback
class AuthorIntegrationSpec extends Specification implements TestDataBuilder {
    ...
}
```
