== Installation
The test framework and testing methodology for Grails has undergone several major revisions over the past few releases.

Unfortunately, this makes it impossible to have one plugin which is compatible with all prior versions.

=== Grails 5.0 or later
`testImplementation "io.github.longwa:build-test-data:{version}"`

=== Grails 4.0
`testCompile "org.grails.plugins:build-test-data:4.0.0"`

=== Grails 3.3
`testCompile "org.grails.plugins:build-test-data:3.3.1"`

=== Grails 3.1 and 3.2
`testCompile "org.grails.plugins:build-test-data:3.0.1"`

NOTE: Version 3.0.x is required for Grails versions 3.0 through 3.2
